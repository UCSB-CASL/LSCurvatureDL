# A Deep Learning Approach for the Computation of Curvature in the Level Set Method

The accompanying _Tensorflow_ models and corresponding normalization statistics are contained in `models/` and `data/`.
Our neural networks have been trained for local resolutions of 256, 266, and 276 equally-spaced nodes along
the Cartesian x- and y- directions.
